## The Office Trivia

Created during Week 5 of KU Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a timed trivia game. After all of the questions were finished, the final scoreboard of how well you did would appear.

## Motivation

My favorite show is The Office, using this as a theme kept me interested and motivated to create something awesome!
